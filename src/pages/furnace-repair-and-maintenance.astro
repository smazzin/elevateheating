He promptly returned my initial phone call and had reasonable pricing (I called some other well known arborists but they were too busy to even return my calls- and others were booked months out). When I asked Gary questions about my mature pear and camellia trees, he had very knowledgable advice about their growth behavior, which I appreciated. Lastly, he showed up on time and got the job done very efficiently. Cleaned up all the mess before he left too! Will be calling for all my future tree trimming and pruning needs.`,
